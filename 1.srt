1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,239
Most men like working on things.

2
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:09,971
Tools, objects, fixing things.
This is what men enjoy doing.

3
00:00:10,288 --> 00:00:13,723
Ever noticed if a guy's in his driveway
working on something with tools...

4
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,912
...how all the other men
in the neighbourhood...

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,622
...are magnetically drawn
to this activity?

6
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:22,270
They just come wandering out
of the house like zombies.

7
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:28,002
Men... It's true. Men hear a drill,
it's like a dog whistle. Just:

8
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:32,171
They go running up
to the living-room curtain.

9
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:35,923
"Honey, I think Jim's working
on something over there."

10
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:38,008
So they run over to the guy.

11
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:39,884
They don't actually help the guy.

12
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:44,366
No. They just want to hang
around the area...

13
00:00:44,474 --> 00:00:47,909
...where work is being done.

14
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:51,870
That's what men want to do.

15
00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:54,371
We want to watch the guy.
We want to talk to him.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,394
We want to ask him dumb questions.
You know...

17
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,667
"What are you using,
a Phillips head?"

18
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:04,898
You know, we feel involved.

19
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:07,191
That's why when they have
construction sites...

20
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,797
...they have to have those wood
panel fences around it.

21
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:12,715
That's just to keep the men out.

22
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,591
They cut those little holes for us...

23
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,405
...so we can see
what the hell is going on.

24
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:21,470
But if they don't cut those holes,
we are climbing those fences.

25
00:01:21,578 --> 00:01:25,430
Right over there. "What are you using,
the steel girders down here?"

26
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:28,974
Yeah, that'll hold.

27
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:43,357
I had to say something.

28
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:45,442
Had to say something.

29
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,360
Everything was going so well.
I had to say something.

30
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:50,132
I don't think you did
anything wrong.

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,884
I told her I liked her. Why?

32
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:55,656
Why did I tell her I like her?

33
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,033
I have this sick compulsion
to tell women how I feel.

34
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:02,014
I like you. I don't tell you.

35
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:04,202
We can only thank God for that.

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,580
I'm out of the picture.
I am out of the picture.

37
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:10,977
Matter of time now.

38
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:15,146
- You're imagining this. Really.
- Oh, no. No, no.

39
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,045
I'll tell you when it happened too.

40
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:24,214
It's when that floss came
flying out of my pocket.

41
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:26,402
What floss? When?

42
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,695
In the lobby, during
the intermission of the play.

43
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,405
I was buying her one of those
containers of orange drink.

44
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,386
For $5.

45
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:35,470
I reach into my pocket
to pay for it. I look down.

46
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,597
There's this piece of green floss
hanging from my fingers.

47
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:41,515
- Mint.
- Of course.

48
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,893
So I'm looking at it.
I look up and see she's looking at it.

49
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,873
Our eyes lock.

50
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:51,208
It was a horrible moment. I just...

51
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:56,941
So let me get this straight.
She saw the floss.

52
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:00,172
You panicked, and you told her
you liked her.

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,048
If I didn't put floss in my pocket...

54
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:06,321
...l'd be crawling around her bedroom
right now, looking for my glasses.

55
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:10,594
- You sure the floss was the catalyst?
- Yes, I am.

56
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:13,929
You don't think it might have
had anything to do with that?

57
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:16,327
What, you don't like this?

58
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:19,558
Looks like your belt is digesting
a small animal.

59
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:25,498
They got a cure for cancer.
See, it's all big business.

60
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:28,625
Oh, hey! Jerry just walked in.

61
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:30,501
Hi, George!

62
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,524
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take my number.

63
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:38,318
It's 555-8643.

64
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,507
Okay. Here he is.

65
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:42,904
- Who is it?
- Take it.

66
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:46,552
- Who is it?
- It's for you.

67
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:49,470
Hello?

68
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,284
Oh, hi, Joel.

69
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:55,411
No. I was out of town.
I just got back.

70
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:58,955
Kramer doesn't know anything.
He's just my next-door neighbour.

71
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,186
Nothing much. Tuesday?

72
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:06,876
Tuesday, no.
I'm meeting somebody.

73
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:09,586
Wednesday?

74
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,755
Wednesday's okay. All right.

75
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:16,569
I'm a little busy right now.
Can we talk Wednesday morning?

76
00:04:16,677 --> 00:04:18,341
Okay. Yeah.

77
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:21,155
Right. Thanks. Bye.

78
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,344
Why do you put me
on the phone with him?

79
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:25,741
I hate just being handed a phone.

80
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:28,138
Well, it's your phone.
He wanted to talk to you.

81
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,327
Maybe I didn't want to talk to him.

82
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:32,411
- Well, why not?
- He bothers me.

83
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,704
I don't answer the phone anymore
because of him.

84
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:37,310
He's turned me into a screener.

85
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:40,332
Now I gotta see him on Wednesday.

86
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:43,042
What? I thought we had tickets
to the Knick game Wednesday.

87
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:44,606
We got seats behind the bench.

88
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,211
- What happened? We're not going?
- We're going.

89
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:49,400
That's next Wednesday.

90
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:53,777
- Who is this guy?
- His name's Joel Horneck.

91
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:56,592
He lived, like, three houses down
from me when I grew up.

92
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,823
He had a Ping-Pong table.
We were friends.

93
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:04,409
Should I suffer the rest of my life
because I like to play Ping-Pong?

94
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:06,806
I was 10!

95
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:10,558
I would've been friends with Stalin
if he had a Ping-Pong table.

96
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:16,394
He's so self-involved.

97
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:21,814
That's for me.

98
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:24,211
Kramerica Industries.

99
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:26,192
Hi, Mark.

100
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:29,840
No, no. Forget that.
I got a better idea.

101
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:32,028
A pizza place where you make
your own pie.

102
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:33,904
Can you conduct your business...

103
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:37,656
...elsewhere?
- No, I'm talking about a whole chain.

104
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:39,845
Yeah.

105
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:45,057
I don't know why you bother
with this Ping-Pong guy, I tell you.

106
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,411
I don't bother with him.

107
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,642
He's been calling me for seven years.
I never called him once.

108
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:52,457
He's got the attention span
of a 5-year-old.

109
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:54,124
Sometimes I sit there...

110
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:57,147
...and I make up things just to see
if he's paying attention.

111
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:59,752
I don't understand why
you spend time with this guy.

112
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:02,150
What can I do, break up with him?

113
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:05,485
Tell him, "I don't think we're right
for each other."

114
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:07,465
It's a guy.

115
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:09,654
At least with a woman
there's a precedent.

116
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:11,842
The relationship goes sour,
you end it.

117
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:16,324
No, no, no. You have to approach
this as if he was a woman.

118
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,930
- Just break up with him?
- Absolutely.

119
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,265
- You just tell him the truth.
- The truth?

120
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,352
No. As a guy, I don't know how
I can break up with another guy.

121
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,437
You know?
I don't know how to say:

122
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:34,355
"Bill, I feel I need to see other men."

123
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:37,065
Know what I mean?
There is nothing I can do.

124
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:39,566
I have to wait for someone to die.

125
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:42,693
I think that's the only way
out of this relationship.

126
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,152
It could be a long time.

127
00:06:45,303 --> 00:06:48,530
See the great thing about guys
is that we can become friends...

128
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,823
...based on almost nothing.

129
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:55,305
Just two guys will just become friends
just because they're two guys.

130
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:58,119
That's almost all we need
to have in common.

131
00:06:58,227 --> 00:07:02,079
Because sports and women
is really all we talk about.

132
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,310
If there was no sports and no women,
the only thing guys would say is:

133
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,707
"So, what's in the refrigerator?"

134
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:14,691
So my shrink wants me to bring
my mother in for a session.

135
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,775
I mean, this guy is a brilliant man.

136
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:18,651
Lenny Bruce used to go to him...

137
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,527
...and I think, Geraldo.

138
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:25,530
I read the Lenny Bruce biography.
I thought it was...

139
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:27,302
Hey, hey, hey! We're starving here!

140
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,907
...interesting...
- We've been waiting here 10 minutes.

141
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:31,575
...that he would...

142
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:36,265
So I'm thinking about going
to Iran this summer.

143
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:38,350
You know, I have to eat.

144
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,020
I mean, I'm hypoglycaemic.

145
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:49,293
Anyway, the Hezbollah
has invited me to perform.

146
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:57,944
- It's their annual terrorist luncheon.
- Yeah.

147
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:00,446
I'm gonna do it in Farsi.

148
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:03,364
Do you think I need a haircut?

149
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:04,927
Are you ready?

150
00:08:04,932 --> 00:08:07,533
Yeah, I'll have the egg salad
on whole wheat.

151
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:11,181
Hey, let me ask you a question.
This turkey sandwich here...

152
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:13,370
...is that real turkey
or is it a turkey roll?

153
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:15,246
I don't want that processed turkey.

154
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,226
I hate it.

155
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,789
I think it's real turkey.

156
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,958
- Is there a real bird in the back?
- No, there's no bird, but...

157
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:25,772
How do you know for sure?
Why don't you do me a favour.

158
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:29,108
Why don't you go in the back
and find out, okay?

159
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,172
Unbelievable.

160
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:38,801
How can you talk
to someone like that?

161
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:42,657
Look, what are you saying?
What, you like turkey roll?

162
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:47,139
Listen, Joel. There's something
I have to tell you.

163
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:49,432
Wait.

164
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,141
You'll never guess who I ran into.

165
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,643
- Howard Metro.
- Howard Metro.

166
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:57,978
He asked me if I still saw you.
I said, "Sure, I see him all the time.

167
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:02,356
We're still great friends."
Anyway, Howard says hello.

168
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:07,150
Listen, Joel.

169
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:10,589
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

170
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,195
What?

171
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,905
This friendship, it's not working.

172
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,094
Not working?
What are you talking about?

173
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,950
We're just not suited to be friends.

174
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:25,077
- But how can you say that?
- Look, you're a nice guy.

175
00:09:25,185 --> 00:09:27,787
It's just that we don't have
anything in common.

176
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,871
Wait. What did I do?

177
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,164
Tell me what...
I want to know what I did.

178
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:35,812
You didn't do anything.
It's not you. It's me.

179
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:38,730
It's... This is very difficult.

180
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,649
Look, I know I call you too much.
Right? I mean, I know.

181
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:44,671
- You're a very busy guy.
- No, it's not that.

182
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:48,840
You're one of the few people
I can talk to.

183
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:51,550
Look, come on.
Now, that's not true.

184
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,635
I always tell everybody about you.

185
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:56,657
I tell everybody to go see his show!

186
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,035
I mean, I'm your biggest fan.

187
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,640
- I know, I know.
- I mean, you're my best friend.

188
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:06,767
Best friend? I've never been
to your apartment.

189
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,685
I cannot believe that this
is happening! I can't believe it.

190
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,333
Okay, okay, forget it.
It's okay. I didn't mean it.

191
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,314
- Didn't mean what?
- What I said.

192
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:18,857
- I've been under a lot of stress.
- Oh, you've been under a lot of stress.

193
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:23,756
Look, just... Can we just forget
the whole thing ever happened?

194
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,257
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
I took it out on you.

195
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:30,322
We're still friends.
We're still friends. Still friends.

196
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:35,846
Okay, look. I tell you what.
I got Knick tickets. This Wednesday.

197
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,452
Great seats behind the bench.
You want to come with me?

198
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,328
Come on.

199
00:10:40,436 --> 00:10:41,891
Tonight?

200
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:45,852
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight,
I would've said tonight.

201
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:49,916
You really want me to go?

202
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:53,252
Yes.

203
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:59,401
- Okay.
- Here, take these.

204
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,840
Okay. Great. That would be...

205
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:05,446
That'd be great. So...

206
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:07,635
...next Wednesday.
- Next Wednesday.

207
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,595
Say, where is that waitress? Hey!

208
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:32,232
She calls me up at the office.
She says, "We have to talk."

209
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,505
The four worst words
in the English language.

210
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:40,362
That or, "Whose bra is this?"

211
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,342
That is worse.

212
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,739
So we order lunch,
and we're talking.

213
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:46,928
Finally, she blurts out
how it's not working.

214
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,283
Really.

215
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,410
So, I'm thinking, as she's saying this,
I'm thinking, "Great.

216
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:54,328
The relationship's over,
but the egg salad's on the way."

217
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:57,455
So now I have a decision.
Do I walk or do I eat?

218
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,539
You ate.

219
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:02,770
Sat there for 20 minutes, chewing.

220
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,793
Staring at each other
in a defunct relationship.

221
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:08,711
Someone says,
"Get out of my life."

222
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:11,421
And that doesn't affect
your appetite?

223
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:13,297
Have you ever had
their egg salad?

224
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:16,215
- It is unbelievable.
- It's unbelievable.

225
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:19,029
Tell you what else is unbelievable.
I picked up the check.

226
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,427
She didn't even offer.
She ended it.

227
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:24,658
The least she could do is
send me off with a sandwich.

228
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:28,514
How much could you
possibly have in there?

229
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,181
Look, it's my money.

230
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,683
All right? What should I do,
throw it out the window?

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,393
I know a guy who took
his vacation on his change.

232
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,686
Yeah? Where'd he go?
To an arcade?

233
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:40,812
That's funny. You're a funny guy.

234
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,210
Come on, move up.

235
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:44,982
Great. Ewing's hurt.

236
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:46,441
How long is he gonna be out?

237
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:49,776
Well, a couple days
at the most, but...

238
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,069
- Oh, God.
- I got scared there for a second.

239
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,424
The Knicks without Ewing.

240
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:56,446
Listen, George.
A little problem with the game.

241
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:58,531
- What about it?
- The thing is, yesterday...

242
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,032
...I kind of...

243
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:06,556
- What?
- I gave your ticket to Horneck.

244
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,165
- You what?
- Yeah.

245
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:16,875
I'm sorry.
I had to give it to Horneck.

246
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:19,897
No.

247
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:25,004
My ticket?

248
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:27,922
- You gave my ticket to Horneck?
- Come on. Go ahead. Move up.

249
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:29,590
What did you give him
my ticket for?

250
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,466
You didn't see him.
It was horrible.

251
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:33,863
Oh, come on, Jerry.
I can't believe this!

252
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:35,739
- I had to do it.
- Oh, please.

253
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,449
Can you change this into bills?

254
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:40,430
I'm sorry, sir, we can't do that.

255
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:42,097
Do you want to go with him?

256
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:44,390
- You go, I don't mind.
- I'm not going with him!

257
00:13:44,394 --> 00:13:46,162
I don't even know the guy!

258
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,142
Look, they did this for me before.

259
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:51,269
Look, I can give you these,
and you can roll them yourself.

260
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:53,979
You want me to roll 6000 of these?

261
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:56,585
What, should I quit my job?

262
00:13:57,006 --> 00:14:00,024
No, I do not like the bank.
I've heard the expression:

263
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:03,568
"Laughing all the way to the bank."
I've never seen anyone actually do it.

264
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:07,111
And those bank lines.

265
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:10,030
I hate it when there's
nobody on the line at all.

266
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:12,531
You now that part?
You go to the bank, it's empty...

267
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,762
...and you still have to go
through the little maze.

268
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:18,993
"Could you get some cheese for me?
I'm almost at the front.

269
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:21,911
I'd like a reward for this, please."

270
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:24,413
- Thirty-two, 33...
- George.

271
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:27,852
Not now, 33...

272
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:30,979
- Thirty...
- Could you stop the counting?

273
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:36,920
- What?
- Can I make it up to you?

274
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:38,483
I'll give you $50 for the jug.

275
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:40,568
Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.

276
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:42,756
Well, then I'm not gonna go
to the game either.

277
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:45,466
Okay, I'll give him both tickets.

278
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:47,759
Go. Go!

279
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,951
l... No, I don't want to go.

280
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:58,390
- He was really crying?
- I had to give him a tissue.

281
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:01,621
In fact, let me call his machine now,
and I'll make up some excuse...

282
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,227
...why I can't go to the game either.

283
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:07,458
Wait. Wait a minute. As long
as you're gonna lie to the guy...

284
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:11,523
...why don't you tell him that you lost
both of the tickets. Then we can go.

285
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,920
George, the man wept.

286
00:15:15,383 --> 00:15:16,838
Hey, guys.

287
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:20,799
Man, I'm telling you, this pizza idea
is really gonna happen.

288
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:26,531
This is the thing where you go and
you have to make your own pizza?

289
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:27,886
We give you the dough.

290
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:31,430
You smash it. You pound it.
You fling it up in the air.

291
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:34,452
And then you get to put your sauce
and sprinkle your cheese.

292
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:38,204
And then,
you slide it into the oven.

293
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:42,165
You have to know how to do that.

294
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:45,917
You can't have people shoving
their arms into a 600-degree oven!

295
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:48,835
- It's all supervised.
- Oh, well...

296
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:50,503
All of it!

297
00:15:51,237 --> 00:15:53,838
- You want to invest?
- My money's tied up in change.

298
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:55,610
You know, look. I'm telling you.

299
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:58,633
People, they really want to make
their own pizza pie.

300
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:02,072
I have to say something,
with all due respect.

301
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:05,303
I just never...
I can't imagine anyone...

302
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:08,221
...in any walk of life,
under any circumstance...

303
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,140
...wanting to make
their own pizza pie.

304
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:13,329
- But that's me.
- Well, okay.

305
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,517
- That's you.
- I'm just saying.

306
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:18,852
I just wanted to check with you guys.
This business is going to be big.

307
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:20,937
I just want to... Okay.

308
00:16:23,964 --> 00:16:28,024
One day, you'll beg me
to make your own pie.

309
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:36,988
Hi, Joel. This is Jerry.
I hope you get this before you...

310
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,489
Oh, hi, Joel. Oh, you just came in.

311
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:44,284
Listen, I can't make it
to the game tonight.

312
00:16:44,392 --> 00:16:46,681
I have to tutor my nephew.

313
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,495
Yeah, he's got an exam tomorrow.

314
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:51,684
Geometry.

315
00:16:52,105 --> 00:16:54,393
You know, trapezoid, rhombus.

316
00:16:54,398 --> 00:16:58,354
Anyway, listen, you take the tickets.
They're at the will-call window.

317
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:03,357
And I'm really sorry. Have a good time.
We'll talk next week, okay? Yeah.

318
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:05,962
Yeah. I don't... Fine.

319
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:07,943
Fine, bye.

320
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:11,382
"Trapezoid"?

321
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:14,509
I know. I'm really running out
of excuses with this guy.

322
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,219
I need some kind of excuse Rolodex.

323
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:27,224
Come on. Let's go do something.
I don't want to just sit around here.

324
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,101
- Wanna get something to eat?
- Where?

325
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,393
I don't care. I'm not hungry.

326
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,833
We could go to one of those
cappuccino places.

327
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:36,813
They let you just sit there.

328
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,106
What are we gonna do there, talk?

329
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,920
We can talk.

330
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:43,901
I'll go if I don't have to talk.

331
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,444
Then we'll just sit there.

332
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:50,779
Okay, I'm gonna check
my machine first.

333
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:57,867
"Picking someone up
at airport, jury duty...

334
00:17:57,975 --> 00:18:02,036
...waiting for cable company."
- Okay, just hand that over, please.

335
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,537
- What is this?
- It's a list of excuses.

336
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:08,810
It's for that guy Horneck, who's
at the game tonight with my tickets.

337
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:12,667
I have that list now, so in case
he calls, I just consult it...

338
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:14,543
...and I don't have to see him.

339
00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:19,129
- God.
- I need it.

340
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:22,881
- What are you doing?
- I got some for you.

341
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:25,382
- Oh, I don't need any more.
- No, no, no.

342
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:27,571
These are good. Listen, listen.

343
00:18:27,575 --> 00:18:30,594
"You ran out of underwear,
you can't leave the house."

344
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:32,782
Very funny.

345
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:36,118
How about you've been diagnosed...

346
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:40,078
...as a multiple personality?
You're not even you.

347
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,163
You're Dan.

348
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:43,518
I'm Dan.

349
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:48,104
- Can I have my list back, please?
- Here. Here.

350
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:51,543
Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot
believe you are doing this.

351
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:53,732
This is absolutely infantile.

352
00:18:56,342 --> 00:19:00,089
- What can I do?
- Deal with it. Be a man.

353
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:01,757
Oh, no.

354
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,385
That's impossible. I'd rather
lie to him the rest of my life...

355
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,366
...than go through that again.

356
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:10,825
He was crying.

357
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:14,681
Tears, accompanied by mucus.

358
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,599
You made a man cry?

359
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,892
I never made a man cry.

360
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:23,957
I even kicked a guy in the groin once,
and he didn't cry.

361
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:26,042
I got the cab.

362
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:30,419
A couple of tough monkeys.

363
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:34,692
Hi, Elaine.

364
00:19:34,697 --> 00:19:36,464
Hey, you missed
a great game tonight.

365
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:37,923
- Game?
- Knick game.

366
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:41,259
Horneck took me. We're sitting
two rows behind the bench.

367
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,656
We were getting hit by sweat!

368
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:47,095
Wait. How does Horneck know you?

369
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:49,805
Last week, when I, you know,
gave you the phone.

370
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:51,681
He's really into my pizza place idea.

371
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,287
- This is too much.
- Wait. What pizza place idea?

372
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,267
Oh, no.

373
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:58,352
You get to make your own pie.

374
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:02,729
That sounds like a great idea.
It would be fun.

375
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:04,605
- Kramer!
- Yeah!

376
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,273
Perfect.

377
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:07,836
Hey!

378
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,484
Okay, who wants meat loaf?

379
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,673
- No, thanks.
- No, no.

380
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:15,862
It's gonna be hot in a minute.

381
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:19,093
So I thought you were
tutoring your nephew.

382
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:22,532
- We finished early.
- I'll bet.

383
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:26,909
So are you going to introduce me
to your nephew?

384
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,932
Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.

385
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,642
Whoa, Nelson.

386
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,039
This is Elaine.

387
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:38,583
- I thought you guys split up.
- We're still friends.

388
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:40,980
So...

389
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:44,524
Thanks again for those tickets,
But next week, I'm gonna take you.

390
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:47,129
How about next Tuesday night?
Why don't you come along.

391
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:52,862
Oh, no, no. Tuesday's no good
because we've got choir practice.

392
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:54,842
Right.

393
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,822
- Forgot about choir.
- Yeah.

394
00:20:56,826 --> 00:20:59,219
We're... We're doing that evening...

395
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:01,721
...of Eastern European
national anthems.

396
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:03,180
Right. You know...

397
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:05,890
...the wall being down and everything.

398
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,476
Well, what about Thursday night?
I mean, they're playing the Sonics.

399
00:21:11,314 --> 00:21:16,312
Thursday is not good because
we've gotta get to the hospital...

400
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:19,856
...to see if we qualify
as those organ donors.

401
00:21:19,964 --> 00:21:21,836
I should really try
something like that.

402
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:24,859
You really should.

403
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,298
Well, let's just take a look here.

404
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:30,070
Forty-one home games.

405
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:32,467
Let's see, Saturday night
we got the Mavericks.

406
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:35,073
If you don't like the Mavericks,
next Tuesday, Lakers.

407
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:36,845
I mean, you gotta like Magic, right?

408
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:39,659
Now, let's see. On the road,
on the road, on the road...

409
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:41,743
Back, back on the 14th.

410
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:45,079
They play the Bulls.
You can't miss Air Jordan...

411
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:49,248
I've come to the conclusion that there
are certain friends in your life...

412
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:52,479
...that they're just always your friends,
and you have to accept it.

413
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:55,501
You see them. You don't want
to see them. You don't call them.

414
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,273
They call you.

415
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:59,670
You don't call back,
they call again.

416
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,110
The way to get through talking
with people...

417
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,882
...you have nothing in common with...

418
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,800
...is to pretend you're hosting
your own little talk show.

419
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:10,718
This is what I do. Pretend there's
a little desk around you.

420
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:14,470
There's a little chair over there,
and you interview them.

421
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:16,554
The only problem is,
there's no way to say:

422
00:22:16,663 --> 00:22:19,682
"Hey, it's been great having
you on the show.

423
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,141
We're out of time."
