1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,158
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
COLUMBIA TRISTAR
DOMESTIC TELEVISION

2
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:07,962
NEVER LIKED THE CHECK AT
THE END OF THE MEAL SYSTEM.

3
00:00:07,996 --> 00:00:10,298
MONEY'S DIFFERENT
BEFORE AND AFTER YOU EAT.

4
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:12,967
BEFORE YOU EAT,
MONEY HAS NO VALUE.

5
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:15,803
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT MONEY
WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY.

6
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:18,773
YOU'RE LIKE THE RULER
OF AN EMPIRE--MORE DRINKS!

7
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:19,941
APPETIZERS!

8
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:21,976
QUICKLY, QUICKLY.

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,980
IT WILL BE THE GREATEST
MEAL OF OUR LIVES.

10
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:30,818
THEN AFTER THE MEAL, YOU KNOW,
YOU GOT THE PANTS OPEN,

11
00:00:30,853 --> 00:00:32,653
YOU GOT
THE NAPKINS DESTROYED,

12
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:35,156
CIGARETTE BUTT
IN THE MASHED POTATOES.

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,825
THEN THE CHECK COMES
AT THAT MOMENT.

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,228
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS UPSET,
YOU KNOW.

15
00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:43,464
THEY'RE MYSTIFIED
BY THE CHECK.

16
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:46,467
WHAT IS THIS?

17
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:48,336
HOW COULD THIS BE?

18
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,671
THEY START PASSING IT
AROUND THE TABLE.

19
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:53,975
DOES THIS LOOK
RIGHT TO YOU?

20
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:55,510
WE'RE NOT HUNGRY NOW.

21
00:00:55,544 --> 00:01:00,348
WHY ARE WE BUYING
ALL THIS FOOD?

22
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:04,585
I THINK SUPERMAN
PROBABLY HAS A VERY
GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR.

23
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,821
I NEVER HEARD HIM
SAY ANYTHING FUNNY.

24
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:08,356
IT'S COMMON SENSE.

25
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,725
HE'S GOT SUPER STRENGTH,
SUPER SPEED.

26
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,060
I'M SURE HE'S GOT
SUPER HUMOR.

27
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:16,197
YOU'D THINK THAT,
BUT EITHER YOU'RE
BORN WITH HUMOR

28
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:18,332
OR YOU'RE NOT.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE.

29
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:21,536
EVEN AFTER GOING
FROM THE RED SUN
OF KRYPTON

30
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,871
TO THE YELLOW SUN
OF EARTH.

31
00:01:23,906 --> 00:01:26,874
WHY? WHY WOULD THAT
ONE AREA OF HIS MIND

32
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,344
NOT BE AFFECTED BY
THE YELLOW SUN OF EARTH?

33
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:33,648
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT HE AIN'T FUNNY.

34
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:37,118
HI. I KNOW, I KNOW.
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

35
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:38,419
NO PROBLEM.

36
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:41,689
I DROPPED A GRAPE.

37
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:42,823
WHAT?

38
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:44,592
I DROPPED A GRAPE
IN THE KITCHEN,

39
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,294
AND IT DISAPPEARED.

40
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:47,662
I COULDN'T FIND IT.

41
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:50,498
I WAS ON MY KNEES
FOR 10 MINUTES

42
00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:53,000
LOOKING FOR
THIS STUPID GRAPE.

43
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:57,538
I HAVE NO IDEA
WH-WHERE IT WENT.

44
00:01:57,573 --> 00:02:00,741
WERE YOU CRYING?
I MEAN, IT'S JUST
A GRAPE.

45
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:02,276
YOU'LL FIND IT.

46
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,946
NO. I'M JUST GETTING OVER
AN ALLERGY ATTACK.

47
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,247
THIS GUY I'M
GOING OUT WITH--

48
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:07,415
ROBERT.

49
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:08,416
ROBERT.

50
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,651
YES. THANK YOU.

51
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:15,389
HE HAS TWO CATS,
AND I'M ALLERGIC TO THEM.

52
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,560
YOU KNOW, I FINALLY
MEET A NORMAL MAN,

53
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:22,563
AND I CAN'T EVEN GO
INTO HIS APARTMENT.

54
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:25,199
OF COURSE MY APARTMENT
IS THE ACTORS' STUDIO,

55
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,068
SO WE CAN'T GO THERE.

56
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:29,070
IT'S CAUSING A LOT OF
PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW?

57
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:32,139
HE WON'T EVEN LEAVE
HIS CATS FOR THE WEEKEND.

58
00:02:32,174 --> 00:02:35,543
GUYS WITH CATS--
I DON'T KNOW.

59
00:02:35,577 --> 00:02:38,312
I'M CONSIDERING
ASKING THIS GIRL
I'M SEEING--

60
00:02:38,347 --> 00:02:39,280
VANESSA?

61
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:42,049
VANESSA. THANK YOU.

62
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:45,419
I'M CONSIDERING
ASKING HER TO GO
AWAY A COUPLE DAYS.

63
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:46,520
OH, NO.

64
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:49,056
I'D HAVE TO
ADVISE
AGAINST THAT.

65
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:51,392
WHAT DO YOU
KNOW THIS WOMAN,
A MONTH?

66
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:53,060
YOU'LL BE
TOGETHER
72 HOURS.

67
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,829
THAT'S
A DATING
DECATHLON.

68
00:02:54,863 --> 00:02:58,833
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE HER TO THAT
PLACE IN VERMONT?

69
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:03,437
IT'S REALLY CHARMING--
WITH SEPARATE FAUCETS
FOR THE HOT AND COLD.

70
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:05,139
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

71
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:09,510
THAT'S EXQUISITE.
LISTEN, IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

72
00:03:09,544 --> 00:03:12,313
COULD YOU PASS ME
THAT PAPER
OVER THERE?

73
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:14,315
JUST THE BUSINESS
SECTION.

74
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:16,017
YOU BETTER
FIND THAT GRAPE

75
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:18,853
BEFORE IT MUTATES
INTO ANOTHER LIFE FORM.

76
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:21,188
THERE WAS ONCE
A MUTANT GRAPE

77
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:22,990
THAT TERRORIZED
AN ENTIRE TOWN

78
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:24,325
IN THE TEXAS PANHANDLE.

79
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:26,127
THEY BROUGHT IN
THE ARMY.

80
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:27,662
NOBODY COULD STOP IT.

81
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:30,398
APPARENTLY, IT HAD
A PIT OF STEEL.

82
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,768
UP AGAIN.

83
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:35,169
THIS IS
INCREDIBLE.

84
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:36,370
I'M--I'M
GETTING IT.

85
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:37,438
GETTING WHAT?

86
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:38,673
A STOCK.

87
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:39,707
WHAT STOCK?

88
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,042
YOU EVER MEET
SIMONS?

89
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:42,076
MAYBE.

90
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,411
HIS FRIEND
WILKENSON

91
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:45,579
MADE A FORTUNE
IN THE MARKET.

92
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:48,516
HE'S GOT
SOME NEW THING--
A BIG MERGER.

93
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,985
I WASN'T EVEN
SUPPOSED TO
SAY ANYTHING.

94
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:52,453
YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER THIS.

95
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,355
HOW HIGH'S IT
SUPPOSED TO GO?

96
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,857
SIMONS SAID
WILKENSON
WOULD TELL ME

97
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:58,959
THE EXACT
MINUTE TO SELL.

98
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:00,428
YOU WANT TO
DO IT?

99
00:04:00,462 --> 00:04:01,796
BOY, I DON'T KNOW.

100
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,297
I GOT NO MONEY.

101
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:04,665
WHAT KIND OF COMPANY?

102
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,200
IT'S CALLED
CENTRAX.

103
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:08,235
THEY GOT
SOME NEW
TECHNIQUE

104
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,204
FOR TELEVISING
OPERA.

105
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:12,073
TELEVISING OPERA?

106
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:14,075
SOME SORT OF
ELECTRONIC THINGY.

107
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:15,342
HOW MUCH
YOU INVESTING?

108
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:16,377
5,000.

109
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:17,912
10. 10,000.

110
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:20,181
5,000.

111
00:04:21,883 --> 00:04:23,084
BOY.

112
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:25,052
COME ON.
WILKENSON'S
GOT MILLIONS

113
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:26,387
INVESTED
IN THIS STOCK.

114
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:27,722
IT'S GONE UP
3 POINTS

115
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:28,923
WHILE I'VE
WATCHED IT.

116
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:31,092
WHAT IF I LOSE IT?

117
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:32,526
COME ON!
TAKE 2,500.

118
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,295
WE'LL DO IT
TOGETHER.
COME ON!

119
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:35,930
WE'RE IN IT
TOGETHER.

120
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:38,199
ALL RIGHT. 2,500.

121
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,467
THAT'S IT.

122
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:41,469
CAN I TAKE
YOUR ORDER?

123
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:43,471
I'LL CHECK
TO THE RAISER.

124
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:44,972
MY BET?
ALL RIGHT.

125
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:48,776
I'LL OPEN WITH
A TUNA SANDWICH.

126
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,044
TUNA?

127
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:51,846
OH, THE DOLPHIN THING?

128
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,848
THEY'RE DYING
IN THE NETS.

129
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:56,484
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE
CONCEPT OF LUNCH

130
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:57,852
IS BASED ON TUNA.

131
00:04:57,886 --> 00:04:59,120
JERRY, CAN'T YOU
INCORPORATE

132
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:02,123
ONE UNSELFISH ACT
IN YOUR DAILY ROUTINE?

133
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:05,626
WHEN I'M DRIVING, I LET
PEOPLE IN ALL THE TIME.

134
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,461
I'M ALWAYS WAVING
EVERYBODY IN.

135
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:10,064
GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.

136
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,735
ALL RIGHT. I'LL HAVE
THE CHICKEN SALAD.

137
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,704
UM, AND I'M
GOING TO HAVE

138
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:19,340
AN ENGLISH MUFFIN,
MARGARINE ON THE SIDE,

139
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:20,341
AND COFFEE.

140
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,709
AND YOU?

141
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:23,277
I'LL HAVE THE TUNA.

142
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:32,686
THOSE PEOPLE
TALKING BEHIND US
RUINED THAT MOVIE FOR ME.

143
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:34,722
WHY DIDN'T YOU
DO SOMETHING?

144
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:36,724
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

145
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:39,160
I GAVE THE GUY
THE HALF TURN.

146
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:44,198
THEN I GAVE HIM
THE FULL TURN
WITH THE EYE ROLL.

147
00:05:44,232 --> 00:05:45,466
BEYOND THAT,

148
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,602
I'M RISKING A PUNCH
IN THE MOUTH.

149
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:51,438
EXCUSE ME. DO YOU HAVE
THESE IN THE PUFFS?

150
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:53,374
NO PUFFS.
JUST FLAKES.

151
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:58,445
HAVE YOU
THOUGHT ANY MORE
ABOUT THAT TRIP?

152
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,581
YEAH. I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT.

153
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:03,017
I HEARD ABOUT
THIS GREAT PLACE
IN VERMONT.

154
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,385
I DON'T KNOW.

155
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:05,886
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT IT.

156
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,388
IT'S LOTS
OF PRESSURE.

157
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:09,423
IT'S GREAT. IT SPEEDS UP
THE INTIMACY LEVEL.

158
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:12,393
