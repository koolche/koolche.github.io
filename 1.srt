1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,526
So I move into the centre lane...

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,859
I get ahead of this woman who felt,
for some reason, I'd cut her off.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,678
So she pulls up alongside of me,
gives me the finger.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,577
It seems like such an arbitrary,
ridiculous thing...

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:24,059
to just pick a finger
and you show it to the person.

6
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:28,020
It's a finger. What does it mean?

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,834
Someone shows me
one of their fingers...

8
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:33,335
and I'm supposed to feel bad.

9
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:36,670
Is that the way it's supposed to work?
I mean...

10
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:40,110
you could just give someone
the toe, really, couldn't you?

11
00:00:40,218 --> 00:00:43,758
I would feel worse if I got the toe
than if I got the finger.

12
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:45,426
It's not easy to give the toe.

13
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:50,429
You gotta get the shoe off, the sock off
and drive, get it up in the...

14
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,992
"Look at that toe, buddy."

15
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:55,536
I mean, that's really insulting,
to get the toe, isn't it?

16
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:03,457
That it? I've got the Q-Tips,
got the mini-umbrella.

17
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:07,522
Something boring to read
on the plane.

18
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:12,421
That's it.

19
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:13,984
Done.

20
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:18,362
That is the single greatest packing
performance I have ever seen.

21
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:22,114
I am the master packer.

22
00:01:22,848 --> 00:01:25,032
Yeah, right. You're the master packer.

23
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:27,742
What you must understand, Elaine...

24
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:30,035
packing is like leading men
into battle.

25
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:34,413
You've got to know the strengths
and weaknesses of every soldier.

26
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:38,790
From a collapsible toothbrush
to a pair of ordinary black socks.

27
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:41,500
Excuse me, master packer?

28
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:43,480
Yes?

29
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:47,441
- Just give me your keys.
- All right, sir.

30
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:51,714
- George?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:55,884
Okay, so, now, is there anything else
I need to know about this place?

32
00:01:55,888 --> 00:02:00,782
Yeah. The hot water takes a while
to come on. So the best thing to do...

33
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:04,430
is to turn it on,
do all your shopping...

34
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:07,140
then come back and take a shower.

35
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:08,912
Okay. This is quite a place.

36
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,726
There's more. The refrigerator.

37
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,374
Deduct a minimum of two days
off all expiration dates.

38
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:19,126
No meat, no leftovers, no butter.

39
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:21,419
And I cannot overstate this:

40
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:25,276
No soft cheeses of any kind.

41
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:28,507
- Is that clear?
- I'll eat out.

42
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,112
And one more thing, Benes...

43
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,093
regarding sexual activity.

44
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,991
Strictly prohibited, but if you
absolutely must, do us all a big favour...

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,868
do it in the tub.

46
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:44,037
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. One second.

47
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:46,747
- Hey, Elaine.
- Hi.

48
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:49,665
- You coming to the airport?
- I'm staying for the weekend.

49
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,521
- I getting a break from my roommate.
- Oh, the actress/waitress.

50
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,899
No. The waitress/actress.
She just got some part...

51
00:02:57,903 --> 00:03:00,922
in some dinner theatre production
of A Chorus Line.

52
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,674
So now all day long she's walking
around the apartment singing:

53
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:11,553
She's gonna get it, right in the...

54
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:14,263
Why don't you just kick her out.

55
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:18,536
She's on the lease. George, you have
got to find another place for me.

56
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:22,601
Yeah, well, a little rough finding
something good in your price range.

57
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:25,832
Hey, but you, my friend,
may be in luck.

58
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,271
- I'm not looking.
- No, this one's different. It's a beauty.

59
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,460
- What's it like?
- I haven't seen it yet...

60
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:34,900
but it's a two-bedroom,
it's on West 83rd...

61
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:37,297
about a half-block from the park.
- How much?

62
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:40,007
Twice what you're paying here,
but it's a great building.

63
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,570
It's two bedrooms.

64
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:43,655
Two bedrooms?
Why do I need two bedrooms?

65
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,573
I've got enough trouble
maintaining activity in one.

66
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:49,909
I saw that.

67
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:53,869
- You ought to at least take a look at it.
- Really? Why?

68
00:03:53,873 --> 00:03:55,954
Because then I could move in here.

69
00:03:57,105 --> 00:04:00,644
- I know what you're saying now.
- It's time you got out of here, anyway.

70
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:03,458
Yeah, tell him, but quickly.
I'm double-parked here.

71
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:06,377
Listen, Jerry,
this place is falling apart.

72
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:08,253
You have no hot water.

73
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:10,337
You can't have soft cheese.

74
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:11,796
Let's not forget the radiator.

75
00:04:11,905 --> 00:04:16,174
The steam's been on for 10 years.
No human can turn this off.

76
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:18,675
Jerry, come on.
You're doing okay now.

77
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:21,073
You should at least
take a look at this place.

78
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:26,388
- You shouldn't have to live like this.
- You just said you wanted to live here.

79
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:28,160
Well, for me it's a step up.

80
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,183
It's like moving
from Iceland to Finland.

81
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,893
Jerry, you wanna see
the place or not?

82
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,707
I can't think about it now.
I'm going to Minneapolis.

83
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:39,312
I got four shows this weekend.

84
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:50,361
Elaine?

85
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:11,102
Elaine?

86
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,665
Jerry?

87
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,584
Jer... Oh, hi.

88
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:18,398
Welcome back.
How were the shows?

89
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:22,046
Great. I had fun. Where's the TV?
Where's the VCR?

90
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:24,547
- What?!
- They were stolen.

91
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:26,423
Stolen? When?

92
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:30,176
A couple of hours ago.
The police are coming right over.

93
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:31,843
Stolen?

94
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:36,638
Someone left the door open.

95
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:38,618
Oh, yeah...

96
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,266
You left the door open?

97
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,976
Oh, well, you know, I was cooking...

98
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,041
and I came in to get the spatula.

99
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:52,793
I left the door open because I was
gonna bring the spatula right back.

100
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:57,066
Wait, you left the lock open
or the door open?

101
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,776
The door.

102
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:04,779
- The door? You left the door open?
- I was bringing the spatula right back.

103
00:06:04,888 --> 00:06:06,238
Yeah, and...?

104
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:09,782
Well, I got caught up watching
a soap opera.

105
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:12,700
Bold and the Beautiful.

106
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:17,182
- So the door was wide open.
- Wide open.

107
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:20,622
Excuse me.

108
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,394
And where were you?

109
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:27,292
I was at Bloomingdale's,
waiting for the shower to heat up.

110
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:30,106
Look, Jerry, I'm sorry.

111
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:32,608
- You have insurance, right, buddy?
- No.

112
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:35,422
How can you not have insurance?

113
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:40,633
Because I spent my money
on the Clapco D-29.

114
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:43,969
It's the most impenetrable lock
on the market today.

115
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:46,574
It has only one design flaw:

116
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:48,659
The door...

117
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,952
must be closed!

118
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:55,330
Jerry, I'm gonna find your stuff.
I'm gonna solve it.

119
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:57,414
I'm on the case, buddy.
I'm on the case.

120
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:01,687
Don't investigate. Don't pay me back.
It was an accident.

121
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:04,606
- I made a mistake.
- These things happen.

122
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:08,254
- I'm human.
- In your way.

123
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:15,758
Let's see, that's one TV, a stereo,
one leather jacket, a VCR, a computer.

124
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:18,155
- Is that about it?
- The answering machine.

125
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:19,927
Answering machine.

126
00:07:19,932 --> 00:07:23,679
Boy, I hate the idea of somebody
out there returning my calls.

127
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,494
What do you mean?

128
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,829
It's a joke.

129
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,913
I see.

130
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,916
Well, Mr. Seinfeld, we'll look into it.
We'll let you know if we find anything.

131
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:39,522
- Do you ever find anything?
- No.

132
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:47,339
- Well, thanks anyway.
- You bet.

133
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,570
I didn't get that joke either.

134
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,697
The crook has the machine.
The messages aren't for him...

135
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,677
he's the crook.

136
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:57,970
Why would he answer...?

137
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:01,097
How did you get in here?

138
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,602
I walked in.
Your lobby door is broken again.

139
00:08:08,606 --> 00:08:09,957
Again?

140
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:11,833
I don't know how
you put up with this.

141
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:13,917
- Yeah. Tell him, George.
- Thanks.

142
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:16,002
You would still wanna move in here?

143
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,982
Yes. You don't understand.

144
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:21,839
I'm living with Ethel Merman
without the talent.

145
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:25,903
Is that other apartment still available?

146
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:32,782
I got ripped off for about the...

147
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:34,971
eighteenth time.

148
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:38,515
The first couple of times
you go through it, it's very upsetting.

149
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,538
Your first reaction,
or one of your friends, will say:

150
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,498
"Call the police.
You really should call the police."

151
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:48,521
So you think to yourself,
you know, you watch TV, you think:

152
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:53,211
"Yeah, I'm calling the police.
Stakeouts, manhunts.

153
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:55,504
I'm gonna see some real action."

154
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:56,963
Right? You think that.

155
00:08:57,072 --> 00:08:59,465
So the police come over
to your house.

156
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:01,966
They fill out the report.

157
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:05,406
They give you your copy.

158
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:10,200
Now, unless they give
the crook his copy...

159
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:13,640
I don't really think we're gonna
crack this case. Do you?

160
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,121
It's not like Batman,
where there's three crooks in the city...

161
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:21,665
and everybody pretty much knows
who they are.

162
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:25,105
Very few crooks go to the trouble...

163
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:29,065
to come up with a theme
for their careers anymore.

164
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,880
It makes them a lot tougher to spot.

165
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:35,423
"Did you lose a Sony?
It could be The Penguin.

166
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:38,550
I think we can round him up.

167
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:40,947
He's dressed like a penguin.

168
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:44,074
We can find him. He's a penguin."

169
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,790
Well, come on.

170
00:09:57,628 --> 00:10:02,522
This is an apartment.
This is a home.

171
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:05,337
This is a place to live.

172
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:08,359
A fireplace!

173
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:10,340
Are you kidding me?
Does this work?

174
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:14,300
I didn't know there was a fireplace.
A fireplace! That's incredible.

175
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:16,906
- How do you get all that wood in here?
- They deliver.

176
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,303
- They deliver wood?
- Yeah.

177
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,013
What do you tip a wood guy?

178
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,391
- I didn't know there was a fireplace.
- Look. Look, look at this.

179
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:28,475
- There's a garden.
- A garden?

180
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:31,394
I can't believe there's a garden.

181
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,312
- Would I have to get a gardener?
- Yeah, you can get a gardener.

182
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:36,605
- You tip him?
- You can.

183
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:38,273
You don't tip a gardener.

184
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:41,608
- You can tip a gardener.
- You don't need a gardener.

185
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:44,422
Jerry, you can barbecue back here.

186
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,298
They deliver the coal?

187
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:49,633
Sure. It's probably the same guy
who delivers the wood.

188
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:51,822
Oh, then I gotta tip him.

189
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,574
Oh, man, this place is incredible.

190
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:57,450
Look at all this great light.

191
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:01,203
- I don't have any plants.
- I have plants.

192
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:05,580
Jerry, look at this closet.

193
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:09,124
Look at this. I'm walking in it.
It's a walk-in.

194
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:12,980
Can you believe it? I'm nuts
about this. What do you think?

195
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:18,713
I like that.

196
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:29,865
- What do you think, George?
- It's your decision.

197
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,671
I'm taking it. I'm taking the place.
I'm gonna take it.

198
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,381
This is gonna be my new place.
I'm living here.

199
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,736
- I'm moving.
- You're moving?

200
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:01,655
That means I'm moving.

201
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:04,156
Gee, is that incredible?

202
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:06,762
Congratulations.

203
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:13,432
- What about the couch?
- You like the couch?

204
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:15,413
- Tell you what I'm gonna do.
- What?

205
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:19,582
You're moving in, you're a good friend.
I wanna start you off on the right foot.

206
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,771
Give me...

207
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:24,376
a hundred and fifty dollars.

208
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:29,483
- In fact, get it out of here right now.
- Excuse me.

209
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:34,382
A hundred and fifty dollars? For what?
For this couch?

210
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,884
- Yeah.
- For this couch?

211
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:40,115
Okay, you tell me.
What is it worth?

212
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:42,929
Okay...

213
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:46,056
I tell you what.

214
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:49,495
I could go as high as...

215
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,101
I don't know. Maybe...

216
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,664
twenty dollars?

217
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:59,188
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's George.

218
00:12:59,297 --> 00:13:01,064
Come on up.

219
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:07,318
Forget it, I'm gonna take it with me.
I'll just pack up the cushions...

220
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:11,174
Okay. Okay, you win. $40.

221
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,259
You wanna help me
get it in the hall?

222
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:17,115
- Fifty dollars, okay? Is that all right?
- Fifty dollars?

223
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:20,451
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

224
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:22,535
Hey. What's going on?

225
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,287
I just bought Jerry's couch for $50.

226
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:28,581
So did you bring the lease?

227
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,541
Okay.

228
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:35,981
Gee, three years.
That kind of seems like a long time.

229
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:37,961
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

230
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:42,339
Listen, if you are feeling
uncomfortable about this at all, at all...

231
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,840
do not feel like you have to take it.

232
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:48,488
- Why?
- If you're having second thoughts...

233
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,051
if you didn't want it...

234
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,012
don't worry about it,
because, you know, I...

235
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,097
I could take it.

236
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,953
You could take it? You want it?

237
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:03,184
No, I don't want it.
I want it if you don't want it.

238
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:05,686
So you do want it.

239
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:07,770
I want it if you don't want it.

240
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:12,669
- You just said you wanted it.
- No, I'm saying if a situation arose...

241
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:15,587
in which you didn't want it,
I might take it.

242
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:17,463
- So take it.
- How can I take it?

243
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,548
- How can I take it?
- It's your apartment.

244
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:21,841
How can I want it now,
if you want it?

245
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:24,342
Excuse me.
I don't mean to cause any trouble...

246
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:28,199
but, George, if you take it,
can I take your place?

247
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:31,847
Yes, but I am not taking it.

248
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:34,557
I am not taking it.

249
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:36,850
Well, one of you better
damn well take it.

250
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,247
- Well, what do you wanna do here?
- I don't know.

251
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:42,165
You wanna flip a coin?

252
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:44,979
Who flips?

253
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:48,002
- You flip, I'll call.
- Okay, fine.

254
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,025
- All right. All right.
- This is the official flip.

255
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:56,028
No crying, no guilt.
Winner takes all and that's it. Agreed?

256
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:58,112
- I'm good.
- I don't know who to root for.

257
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,718
George's place has carpeting.

258
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:03,845
- All right. Now, you call it in the air.
- No catching.

259
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:05,512
- No, no.
- All right, flip it.

260
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:06,971
Heads!

261
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:12,079
- Tails.
- No, it hit the table.

262
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,205
- So what?
- Interference. You can't count that.

263
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,228
Come on, are you crazy?
The coin cannot touch anything.

264
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:21,251
- It affects it.
- You didn't call "no interference."

265
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,231
You don't have to call it.
That's a rule!

266
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,149
- I don't believe this.
- All right. Fine, Jerry.

267
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,797
- You win. Take it, just take it.
- I don't wanna win it like this.

268
00:15:29,906 --> 00:15:32,924
Elaine, what do you think?

269
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,842
I better not.

270
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:41,679
I'll tell you what,
I'll choose you for it.

271
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:44,910
Straight choose, three takes it.
No disputes.

272
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:47,203
That's it. You gotta win three.

273
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,871
Okay.

274
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:54,187
Okay.

275
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,063
I'll choose you.

276
00:15:57,943 --> 00:16:00,336
- What do you want?
- Odds.

277
00:16:00,653 --> 00:16:03,671
- I want evens.
- Good.

278
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:07,007
- You got odds.
- You got evens.

279
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:08,466
Right.

280
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:11,593
- Ready.
- For the apartment.

281
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,573
- Once, twice, three, shoot!
- Mine!

282
00:16:13,577 --> 00:16:15,449
- Once, twice, three, shoot.
- Mine!

283
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,621
- Once, twice, three, shoot!
- Mine!

284
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,122
Once, twice, three, shoot!

285
00:16:31,296 --> 00:16:33,272
Congratulations.

286
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,565
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

287
00:16:35,673 --> 00:16:38,483
I'm just gonna wash...

288
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:44,320
Why did I put out two?
Why did I put out two?!

289
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,968
Jerry? I think I'm on to something.

290
00:16:48,702 --> 00:16:50,469
I think I found your stuff.

291
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:52,971
You know the Englishman
who lives down the hall?

292
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:55,472
The last couple days,
he's been acting very strange.

293
00:16:55,477 --> 00:16:57,974
- I think he's avoiding me.
- Hard to imagine.

294
00:16:57,978 --> 00:17:02,247
Yeah, and get this. I just got off the
elevator with him and I tested him.

295
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:05,999
I tested him, like, this is what I said,
like this. I went:

296
00:17:06,004 --> 00:17:09,960
"Oh, by the way,
I know about the stuff."

297
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:12,983
You know, very casual so he'll take me
into his confidence.

298
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:16,214
- So, what did he say?
- "What stuff?"

299
00:17:18,094 --> 00:17:20,904
- Case closed.
- No, no. You don't understand.

300
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:24,343
See, he swallowed.
See, the guy, he swallowed.

301
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:27,575
Oh, he was nervous about something.

302
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:32,056
Now, I'm gonna go over there.
I'm gonna borrow some tea.

303
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:35,600
If I don't get back in five minutes,
you better call the police.

304
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:38,727
Okay. Starting now!

305
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:40,395
Yeah.

306
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:44,772
One problem in life is...

307
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:47,795
as a kid, you have a certain way
of working out disagreements.

308
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:51,130
And those laws do not work
in the adult world.

309
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:55,403
One of the main ways that kids resolve
any dispute is by calling it.

310
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:59,155
One of them says, "I got the front
seat." "I wanted it." "I called it."

311
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:03,533
And the other kid knows
he's got nothing to say.

312
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:05,409
"He called it. What can I do?"

313
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:07,702
If there was a kid court of law,
it holds up.

314
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:12,914
"Your Honour, my client did ask
for the front seat."

315
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:16,145
And the judge would go,
"Did he call it?"

316
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:20,209
"Well, no, he didn't call it." Bang.
"He has to call it. Case closed.

317
00:18:20,214 --> 00:18:22,607
Objection overruled."

318
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,359
I love the mirror in that bathroom.

319
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:29,798
I don't know what in the hell it is,
I look terrific in that mirror.

320
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:32,300
I don't know if it's the tile
or the lighting.

321
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:34,906
I feel like Robert Wagner in there.

322
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:38,137
It's a good mirror.

323
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:41,680
- What are you getting?
- I don't know.

324
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,495
What can you eat?
You can't have anything anymore.

325
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:48,559
Look at this, look at this.
Eggs, out. Coffee, out.

326
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:51,686
French fries, out. BLT, out.

327
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:56,168
I visit my grandparents,
they're eating big brisket sandwiches.

328
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:58,357
I'm sitting there with a carrot.

329
00:18:58,465 --> 00:19:02,109
They're closing in on 100, I'm saying
to them, "How can you eat that stuff?"

330
00:19:07,742 --> 00:19:10,656
I'm so sick about losing that choose.
You don't know. I...

331
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:14,616
All right. Forget it. Forget it.
I'm not taking the place.

332
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:16,805
- What?
- How can I live there?

333
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:18,994
- Why not?
- You're still thinking about it.

334
00:19:19,102 --> 00:19:21,912
- I'll never feel comfortable.
- Oh, get out of here.

335
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,935
How can I ever have you over?
You'll sit there moping.

336
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:27,749
- I won't mope.
- You're already moping.

337
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:31,710
- Would you take the place?
- No. Impossible. It's your apartment.

338
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:34,524
- You found the place.
- You won the choose.

339
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,234
All right. Forget it. I'm not moving.

340
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:38,797
Well, me neither.

341
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:41,194
- Definitely?
- Definitely.

342
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:45,572
All right, then, just get rid of it.
You won't have any problem.

343
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:49,428
No, it's not a problem. I can get rid
of the apartment this afternoon.

344
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:51,200
What apartment?

345
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:53,702
Oh, it's a great place.
It's a two-bedroom...

346
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,203
West 83rd, half-block from the park.

347
00:19:56,207 --> 00:19:58,288
What's the rent?

348
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:12,880
I hate housewarmings. What are
we doing here? This is ridiculous.

349
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:15,277
She wanted to thank us
for the apartment.

350
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:21,843
I can't believe I lost the deposit
on that U-Haul...

351
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:25,074
and I threw out my couch.

352
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,911
- If only the coin hadn't hit the table.
- The table is interference, you know it.

353
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,308
- It is not.
- It is too.

354
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:37,477
My roommate starts rehearsal tonight
on Carousel.

355
00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:41,542
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Carol.

356
00:20:41,546 --> 00:20:45,294
I just wanted to introduce you
to my husband. This is Larry.

357
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:48,525
This is George, Elaine and Jerry.

358
00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:51,756
These are the guys
who got us the apartment.

359
00:20:52,073 --> 00:20:54,050
You don't know how grateful I am.

360
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:56,551
If there's anything I can do
to repay you...

361
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:59,261
- We're just so thrilled with this place.
- It's a dream.

362
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:01,554
I'm running in the park,
I've lost weight...

363
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:05,306
we're barbecuing every night.
And the rent is unbelievable.

364
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,039
We're really glad for you.

365
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:13,644
Couldn't be happier.

366
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:15,208
It's wonderful.

367
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,960
Oh, Diane. Diane, come here.

368
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:22,295
This is my new next-door
neighbour, Diane.

369
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:27,194
These are the guys who turned
this place down. Can you believe it?

370
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:31,571
Diane gave me the greatest back rub
today. She's a masseuse.

371
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:37,512
How could you guys
have turned this place down?

372
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:41,994
It's such a great location
and it's so close to the park.

373
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:45,434
We're aware of the proximity
to the park.

374
00:21:46,793 --> 00:21:50,332
Well, it was nice to meet you.

375
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:52,625
Nice meeting you.

376
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:06,592
How late are the stores open? I'm
thinking of maybe buying a new TV...

377
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,302
and smashing it over my head.

378
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:11,803
So I get a call
from Gilmore this morning.

379
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:16,181
They're restructuring the organization
in Atlanta. I gotta be there on the 1 st.

380
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:17,849
Really?
What about your apartment?

381
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:20,142
What can I do? I'll give it up.

382
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,330
What's the rent?
